## Action item

- Goal: start writing code and getting concrete work done
- Change: assign individuals user stories
- Measurement: see how many user stories we get done this week

## Retro Assessment

- A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.
- A brief assessment of how it went.
- What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?

I used Start, Stop, Continue for leading the retro. I felt that it was a pretty effective way of organizing people's feedback and thoughts, since everything really falls into one of those three categories. However, we didn't really have a lot to say, since we've mostly just been brainstorming. I think everyone was also itching to get to work, so I cut the retro a little short. It might be good to prepare a couple of questions in advance to ask the team to stimulate further discussion next time.

## Action item

- Goal: Develop a more specific vision of where we want our application to go
- Change: Create user stories from the beginning of each iteration that fully encompasses the vision we have set out to achieve
- Measurement: after conferencing about each of our specific ideas regarding our respective visions, we will produce an artifact (descriptive or visual) and place into our team repo that we can compare with our production app

## Retro Assesment

Once again, we used the start, stop, continue method. This retro was successful in highlighting the biggest issue that our team is currently facing; namely, an absence of a unified vision of the product we are attempting to deliver. While this is no simple task and near impossible to accomplish in the span of an hour, we were able to establish an approach that will allow more effective sharing of each of ideas, resulting in a production app that will hopefully satisfy each of our visions. In the future, however, it may be more efficient to have a structured plan of sharing, rather than the dynamic of "speak when an idea comes to you".

## Action item

- Goal: Create a final, useable product.
- Change: Creating user stories that we are satisfied with and that we will not need to go back and change/add more. Stop adding more features rather fine tuning the ones that we have.
- Measurement: Using our testing to assure that everything is working properly and look at the final criteria to have checked off all of the boxes.

## Retro Assesment

We chose the start, stop, continue method once again. I chose to lead it slightly differently, I started with a question that I propsed to everyone which was if you could go somewhere in the world where would you go because I read that if people talk in the beginning they are more likely to talk throughout. I then proceeded with the start, stop, continue but I also tried to make sure that everyone had a say. The retro was successful in coming to a conclusion of what we want to focus in our next sprint since this is the last one. Ultimately we decided that we needed to really focus on creating a useable product and making sure that everything works rather than trying to add more features. I feel like this was one of our better retros as we all shared our opinions.
